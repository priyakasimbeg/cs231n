Review of GAN-based architechtures for medical imagge processing applications including:
- synthesis
- de-noising
- reconstruction

Classification of GANS:
- latent space to image
- image to image

Section 4.5: Image denoising.

Overview of GAN architectures:
1. GAN: Generator G, Discriminator D. Min-max optimization function. Challenges include mode colllapsing (When G collapses to map all latent space inputs to the same data),
